You're right\! Let's get those updates in for the `privacy_budgeter.py` file, incorporating the advanced concepts discussed, such as tighter composition, more dynamic factors, and the potential for a persistent privacy accounting system.

-----

## Updated `privacy_budgeter.py`

This updated version introduces:

  * A placeholder for a more sophisticated **privacy accounting class**.
  * The concept of different **DP composition types** (though the actual implementation of advanced composition is complex and often done with specific libraries).
  * More realistic bounds and potential for **learned user preferences**.
  * A clearer distinction for `remaining_global_budget`'s impact.

    Calculates a Differential Privacy (epsilon) budget for a single operation
    based on various contextual and user-defined factors.

    A lower epsilon value indicates higher privacy.
    This function simulates the Local Agent's nuanced privacy budgeting logic.

    Args:
        user_preference (Literal): User's general privacy preference or a learned profile.
            - "maximize_privacy": Prioritize privacy above all.
            - "balanced": Seek a balance between privacy and utility.
            - "maximize_utility": Prioritize utility, accepting lower privacy.
            - "learned_profile": Inferred preference from user's historical behavior.
        data_sensitivity (Literal): The inherent sensitivity of the data being processed.
            - "critical": Extremely sensitive, e.g., medical records with specific diagnosis.
            - "high": Sensitive PII, financial details.
            - "medium": Less sensitive personal data, aggregate statistics from private sources.
            - "low": Publicly available or non-identifiable derived data.
            - "public": Already public, no privacy needed.
        contextual_risk (Literal): Risk level based on the current environment.
            - "high_risk_public": Public network, untrusted device/location.
            - "medium_risk_private": Private network, known device/location, some shared access.
            - "low_risk_trusted": Highly secure, personal device, trusted private network.
        task_utility_requirement (Literal): How critical the data utility is for the task.
            - "absolute_critical": Task fails completely without high fidelity (e.g., life-critical decisions).
            - "high": Task strongly depends on high data fidelity.
            - "moderate": Task benefits from good fidelity but can tolerate some noise.
            - "low": Task is robust to high noise (e.g., simple trend analysis, general recommendations).
        privacy_accountant (Optional[PrivacyAccountant]): An instance of PrivacyAccountant
            to check and potentially deduct from a global budget. If None, no global budget check.
        current_query_number (int): The sequential number of the current query in a session.
            Used to illustrate the concept of advanced composition (makes epsilon tighter for early queries).

    Returns:
        float: The calculated epsilon (privacy budget) value. A lower value implies
               stronger privacy guarantees. Returns float('inf') if data is public
               or if global budget is exhausted and no sharing is possible.
