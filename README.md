## üöÄ Overview

**Veridian** is a novel multi-agent AI architecture designed to empower users with **contextual and adaptive control** over their data and AI interactions in distributed environments. It addresses the critical challenges of maintaining user trust and privacy when AI systems operate across both on-device (edge) and cloud-based components.

At its core, Veridian leverages a tripartite agent model to intelligently manage privacy-utility trade-offs and ensure trustworthy AI interactions:

  * **Local Agent (on-device):** Acts as the user's personal intelligent proxy, dynamically sensing context, inferring privacy intent, and deciding on delegation.
  * **Translation Agent (flexible deployment):** Mediates between local and remote environments, applying privacy-preserving transformations and orchestrating secure routing. This agent can reside **on-device, at the edge, or in the cloud** depending on the specific use case's privacy, latency, and computational requirements.
  * **Remote Agent (cloud):** Provides specialized AI expertise, interacting only with privacy-processed data from the Translation Agent.

Veridian aims to build AI systems where privacy is not an afterthought but a foundational principle, dynamically integrated with adaptive intelligence.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Dynamic Privacy Control:** Adapts Differential Privacy (DP) parameters ($\\epsilon$) based on user intent, query sensitivity, and environmental context (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
  * **Intelligent Delegation:** Local Agent decides whether to handle tasks locally or securely delegate to other agents.
  * **Flexible Translation Layer:** The Translation Agent's adaptable deployment location (on-device, edge, or cloud) allows for fine-tuning privacy, performance, and trust boundaries per use-case.
  * **Contextual Policy Enforcement:** Translation Agent applies PII masking, data optimization, and specialized routing based on real-time needs.
  * **On-Device Learning:** Local Agent can learn and adapt its capabilities from privacy-preserved insights, improving over time.
  * **User-Centric Configuration:** Flexible `ClientConfig` allows users to set high-level privacy presets or fine-tune granular controls.
  * **Trustworthy Architecture:** Designed to enhance user control, transparency, and accountability in distributed AI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Conceptual Flow)

1.  **User Query:** A user interacts with an application running a **Local Agent**.
2.  **Local Assessment:** The Local Agent analyzes the query for sensitivity (PII), assesses its confidence in handling it locally, and senses environmental context (e.g., network type). It then dynamically calculates a privacy budget (epsilon) based on these factors and the user's `ClientConfig`.
3.  **Delegation Decision:** If the Local Agent cannot confidently handle the query locally or if it requires specialized remote expertise, it prepares to delegate.
4.  **Translation & Orchestration:** The query, along with privacy parameters and intents (e.g., "PII masking needed," "use this epsilon for data contribution"), is sent to the **Translation Agent**. The Translation Agent (wherever it's deployed) orchestrates a pipeline of transformations:
      * Masks PII.
      * Abstracts and optimizes the problem for remote processing (if delegation to a `Remote Agent` is occurring).
      * Applies Differential Privacy if anonymized data contribution is enabled.
      * Routes to the appropriate **Remote Agent** (if applicable).
5.  **Remote Processing (if applicable):** The Remote Agent processes the abstracted, privacy-preserved query and returns a response.
6.  **Insight Distillation & Return:** The Translation Agent distills the remote response into actionable insights for the Local Agent and returns the final response to the user. If enabled, it also provides privacy-preserved learning principles for the Local Agent's on-device model.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started (Prototype)

The provided `veridian_system.py` file contains a Python prototype demonstrating the core `LocalAgent`, `TranslationAgent`, and `RemoteAgent` logic.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krimler/veridian.git
    cd veridian
    ```
2.  **Run the simulation:**
    ```bash
    python veridian_system.py
    ```
    This will execute several predefined scenarios, showcasing Veridian's dynamic privacy controls, delegation, and adaptive behavior.

**Note:** The current prototype uses `mock_llm_call` for simplicity. For a full implementation, you would integrate with actual LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) for the Remote Agent and potentially for some Translation Agent functions. The flexible deployment of the Translation Agent would also involve specific configuration and infrastructure setup not covered in this basic Python script.

## üî¨ Research & Future Work

Veridian is a research project exploring the frontiers of trustworthy, user-centric distributed AI. Our ongoing work focuses on:

  * Integrating with real-world LLM APIs and datasets.
  * Conducting rigorous quantitative evaluations of privacy-utility trade-offs across different Translation Agent deployment scenarios.
  * Implementing sophisticated on-device learning algorithms for the Local Agent.
  * Developing formal verification methods for the privacy pipeline.
  * Conducting comprehensive user studies to assess perceived privacy and control.
